Things you know in order to make this program work:
- MySQL (I used PHPMyAdmin)
- Visual studio


Before you can run the program:
- You need to go into 'UpOrDownFiles -> UpOrDwonFiles.sln' then go to the 'UserInterface.cs' and change the "RootFolder" on line 21
- You also need to change the DownloadFolder on line 13,of where the file end up after you download it.
- Import the filedatabase.sql
- In the database to into users and make a user so you can log into the program, you are not able to make a user in the program.


Why did i make this program/What is the program:
I made this program for a school project, at first i had no idea what to do, but i ended up with the idea about make a program that could
upload and download files. The way it's setup right now, all the files are stored on the local PC, but if this would make it out to a real
company, you would set it up so it runes over a fileserver.
